# 🧠 Julian Smith – Cybersecurity Builder & Analyst

> I'm a self-taught cybersecurity practitioner who started with no formal training — just a strong drive to learn and build. I began by refreshing core IT fundamentals, worked through modern security concepts using only free resources, and earned my CompTIA Security+ certification entirely on my own. Alongside this, I built real-world lab environments and modular tools from scratch, documenting every step to deepen understanding. I use a modern, AI-augmented workflow to accelerate my learning — not as a crutch, but as a force multiplier — enabling me to take on projects that align with real SOC and blue team environments. Everything I build is grounded in application, clarity, and continuous growth.

## 🧠 AI-Augmented Workflow

My entire learning system is built around a self-designed AI-augmented workflow — not as a shortcut, but as a second brain.

* I use ChatGPT as a **lab assistant** to document in real time while I execute commands and build systems
* I actively **pause to reflect**, ask questions, and iterate on complex concepts (e.g., OSI model, file permissions, GRUB recovery)
* I use it to **refactor code**, write documentation, brainstorm project ideas, and simulate exam environments
* All projects are driven by hands-on execution — AI helps me move faster, but never replaces real understanding

> *“Everything I build is mine. AI helps me test, explain, and document — but I make every decision, write every command, and fix every mistake.”*
