# 🧠 Julian Smith – SOC-Focused Cybersecurity Builder & Analyst

> I'm a self-taught cybersecurity practitioner focused on blue team operations and SOC readiness. I started with no formal training — just a relentless drive to understand real-world security workflows. I earned my Security+ certification through independent study and built hands-on lab environments that simulate alert triage, log parsing, incident reporting, and infrastructure hardening.
>
> My approach is grounded in **clarity, application, and continuous iteration**. I document everything I build — not just to retain knowledge, but to **scale my growth like a system**. I also leverage a custom AI-augmented workflow that enables me to move fast, reflect deeply, and train like a junior analyst long before day one.

## 🧠 AI-Augmented Workflow

My entire learning system is built around a self-designed AI-augmented workflow — not as a shortcut, but as a second brain.

* ChatGPT functions as a **live lab assistant**, documenting my process while I execute hands-on tasks
* I **pause to reflect** mid-build, ask why something works, then reattempt it with minimal support
* I use AI to **refactor code**, brainstorm project ideas, and simulate exam environments
* Every lab is **built, broken, and fixed** with my own hands

> *"Everything I build is mine. AI helps me test, explain, and document — but I make every decision, write every command, and fix every mistake."*
