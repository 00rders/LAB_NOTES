# IRIS â€“ Incident Response Intelligence System

This folder is a placeholder for my IRIS project, a standalone SOC automation assistant that Iâ€™m developing.

ðŸ‘‰ Full code and documentation are hosted in the dedicated IRIS GitHub repository:  
[https://github.com/00rders/iris](https://github.com/00rders/iris)

---

IRIS is designed to:
- Automate alert triage and log parsing
- Enrich indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Generate Markdown-formatted incident reports
- Act as a CLI-based SOC copilot for training and real-world simulation

Inspired by real-world SOC analyst workflows, the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, and the DFIR open-source community.
