# Splunk Data Ingestion — Training & Local Logs

# Hydration Prompt — Splunk Data Ingestion (Training & Local Logs)

You are GPT-5 Thinking, my SOC/SIEM coach. Design a **noob→job-ready mini-course** on Splunk data ingestion that I can complete on my Hot Lab (Ubuntu Server VM running Splunk 9.x). Keep it **hands-on-first**, concise, and execution-focused.

## My Context
- I have Splunk Web accessible on my VM.
- I prefer **local-first** methods and minimal external downloads.
- I want repeatable labs I can run anytime.

## Outcomes
- Understand Splunk ingestion paths (GUI Add Data, CLI `splunk add monitor`, UF, HEC) and when to use each.
- Successfully ingest:  
  1) **Built-in** data for drills (`index=_internal`),  
  2) **Local system logs** (e.g., `/var/log/auth.log`),  
  3) **One training file** I can create or extend later (no internet required).
- Verify ingestion with SPL and field extraction awareness (source, sourcetype, host, index).

## Course Structure (build it for me)
1) **Concept Primer (5 bullets max):** inputs, sourcetype, time, line-breaking, index.
2) **Hands-On A — Built-in data:** use `_internal` to warm up (2 SPL checks + why they matter).
3) **Hands-On B — Local logs:** ingest `/var/log/auth.log` via CLI monitor **and** via GUI; show pros/cons.  
   - Include exact commands/UI clicks, and the expected **verification SPL** + **expected output** and **how to interpret** it.
4) **Hands-On C — Training file:** create a tiny text log locally, pick a sensible sourcetype, monitor it, and verify.  
   - I will supply content later; you just scaffold the steps.
5) **Troubleshooting Cheatsheet:** 6 common ingestion gotchas (permissions, sourcetype wrong, timestamp, CR/LF, rotation, index visibility) + quick fixes.
6) **Checkpoint Quiz (3 Qs)** and **Short Reflection (2 prompts)**.

## Constraints
- No external downloads required to complete core steps.
- Use clear sections, code blocks, and **expected output** examples.
- Keep each step minimal; avoid over-explaining.

## Deliverables
- Step-by-step lab with commands/UI steps, verification SPL, expected output tables/snippets, and interpretation notes.
- A final **Run-Again** section that summarizes only the commands/SPL I need next time.

Start now with the **Concept Primer**, then proceed to Hands-On A.
