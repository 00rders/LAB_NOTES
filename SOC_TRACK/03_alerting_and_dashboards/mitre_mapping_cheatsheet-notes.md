| Lateral Movement          | `T1021.001` â€” Remote Desktop Protocol | RDP session usage |
|                          | `T1077` â€” Windows Admin Shares | Lateral move via shares |
| Collection                | `T1113` â€” Screen Capture | Spyware, RATs |
| Exfiltration              | `T1041` â€” Exfiltration over C2 Channel | Data theft via outbound C2 |

## ðŸ§  Mapping Tips

- **Start with behavior, not tool**  
  > Don't assume "PowerShell" = `T1059`; context matters.

- **Use multi-technique mapping if needed**  
  > A lateral movement attempt could involve `T1021.001`, `T1078`, and `T1027`.

- **Include MITRE tags in reports**  
  > Standardizes your write-ups and improves SOC searchability.

### ðŸ¤– IRIS Integration Ideas

- Suggest MITRE technique(s) during alert triage
- Auto-tag parsed logs with mapped tactics/techniques
- Track most frequent tactics in shift summary reports
- Use MITRE tags to prioritize detection engineering needs
