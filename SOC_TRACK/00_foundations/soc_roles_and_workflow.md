# SOC Roles & Workflow

## 📖 Concept
Explain the Security Operations Center’s purpose, core team roles (Tier 1–3 analysts, Incident Responders, Threat Hunters), and the general lifecycle of incident handling.

## 🛠 Hands-On in Splunk Lab
1. Log into your Splunk Hot Lab.
2. Navigate to `Search & Reporting` → Observe available indexes/log sources.
3. Write down what log types you see and think about which SOC role might use them.

## 🌍 Real-World SOC Example
You’re Tier 1 at a financial SOC. You spot multiple failed logins on an executive account.  
- **Tier 1**: Confirm event, escalate.  
- **Tier 2**: Deep dive into correlated logs.  
- **Tier 3**: Containment and remediation.

## 📝 Mini Quiz
