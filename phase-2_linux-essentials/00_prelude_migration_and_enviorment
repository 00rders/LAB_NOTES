# Prelude — Migration, Environment Customization, and Command Line Warm-up

## 🧩 Context  
Before diving fully into Linux essentials, I transitioned to a clean user environment and ensured that my OPSEC lab setup carried over smoothly. This session served as a hands-on intro to Linux navigation and configuration while reinforcing file and permission concepts.

## 🔧 What I Did

### 🛠️ User Migration & Cleanup
- Migrated from the default `kali` user to a new `oorders` user for a cleaner OPSEC-focused environment.
- Transferred my full `opsec-lab/` folder and ensured ownership/permissions were set correctly using `chown` and `chmod`.
- Unhid essential folders like `Downloads/` that were accidentally hidden (dot-prefixed).
- Verified folder visibility and access with `ls -la`.

### ⚙️ Zsh Environment Setup
- Set Zsh as the default shell.
- Installed and configured plugins for:
  - **Syntax highlighting**
  - **Command autosuggestions**
- Confirmed plugins were working by testing color-coded feedback and inline suggestions.
- Customized `.zshrc` with aliases and terminal behavior improvements.

### 🔐 Permission Handling
- Used `chmod` to correct directory visibility and restrict access (`chmod 700`).
- Ensured full access to my lab tools, notes, and scripts from the new user context.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to move and manage user directories securely during system transitions.
- How to set and interpret file/directory permissions using `ls -la`, `chmod`, and `chown`.
- How shell customizations improve workflow speed and reduce typing errors.
- That hiding folders (with `.` prefix) can be used intentionally for privacy or accidentally by mistake.
- The value of aliases and shell history management in maintaining OPSEC hygiene.

## 🔒 Why It Matters

- A clean, personalized user environment reduces clutter and risk of user-based permission errors.
- Knowing how to manage hidden files and user data is critical for system audits and secure file management.
- Mastery of the shell and its customization is a key foundational skill for penetration testing, scripting, and automation.

This migration phase ensured my lab is secure, clean, and ready for deeper Linux command line training.
