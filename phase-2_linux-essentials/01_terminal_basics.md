# 01 — Terminal Basics

## 🧩 Context  
The terminal is a powerful tool for interacting with the Linux operating system. This module provides a hands-on introduction to basic terminal commands for file navigation, system management, and file manipulation. Mastering these commands is essential for efficiently using Linux in any cybersecurity or system administration context.

## 🔧 What I Did

### 🛠️ Basic Commands for Navigation and File Management
- **`pwd`**: Printed the working directory to confirm the current location in the file system.
- **`ls` and `ls -l`**: Listed the contents of directories and explored detailed file information, such as permissions, owner, size, and modification date.
- **`cd`**: Changed directories to navigate through the file system.
- **`mkdir`**: Created new directories.
- **`rm` and `rmdir`**: Deleted files and empty directories.
- **`touch`**: Created empty files.
- **`cat`**: Displayed the contents of a file.
- **`echo`**: Printed text to the terminal or wrote it to a file.

### ⚙️ File Permissions and Ownership
- Explored basic file permissions using `chmod`, `chown`, and `ls -l`.
- Created and modified file permissions using the numeric system (e.g., `chmod 700`).
- Investigated how directory and file permissions affect access and security.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- **File Management**: Commands like `ls`, `mkdir`, `touch`, and `rm` are essential for creating, viewing, and managing files and directories.
- **Permissions**: Understanding how file permissions and ownership work allows you to manage access control and secure your system.
- **Navigation**: Using `cd` and `pwd`, I learned how to efficiently navigate through the file system and view the current working directory.
- **Command Combinations**: Combining commands like `ls -l` and `chmod` provides deeper insights into system administration and security.

## 🔒 Why It Matters
- **Foundation for Cybersecurity**: Mastering terminal basics is essential for navigating Linux, managing files, and securing systems, which are key aspects of penetration testing, system administration, and security audits.
- **Efficiency**: Familiarity with terminal commands boosts productivity, allowing faster navigation and file management compared to graphical interfaces.
- **Security**: Understanding file permissions and ownership is critical for controlling access to sensitive files and ensuring system security.

### ✅ Future Topics to Explore:
- **Advanced File Permissions**: Access Control Lists (ACLs), special permissions (SUID, SGID, sticky bits).
- **Pipes and Redirection**: Using pipes (`|`) to chain commands and redirecting output (`>`, `>>`, `2>`, `&>`) for powerful workflows.
- **Process Management**: Managing and monitoring processes with `ps`, `top`, `kill`, and `htop`.
- **Searching and Finding**: More advanced searching tools like `locate`, `ack`, and `ag`.
- **File Compression and Archiving**: Using commands like `tar`, `gzip`, `zip`, and `unzip`.
- **Shell Scripting**: Automating tasks with shell scripts, conditional statements, loops, and functions.
