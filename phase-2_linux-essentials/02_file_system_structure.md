## 🔧 What I Did

### 🛠️ Key Linux Directories Explored
- **`/` (Root Directory)**: The top-level directory in the file system.
- **`/etc` (Configuration Files)**: Contains system configuration files.
- **`/home` (User Directories)**: Stores personal user directories.
- **`/bin` (Binaries)**: Contains essential system binaries and executables.
- **`/var` (Variable Files)**: Stores files that change frequently, such as logs and caches.
- **`/media`**: Stores external device mount points.
- **`/mnt`**: Used for manually mounting filesystems.
- **`/tmp` (Temporary Files)**: Stores temporary files.

### 🔍 What I Learned
- **Linux File Hierarchy**: The Linux file system is structured in a tree-like hierarchy starting from the root directory (`/`).
- **Key Directories**: Important directories like `/etc`, `/home`, and `/var` are essential for system configuration, user data, and logs.
- **Practical Exploration**: Learned how to navigate and list the contents of key system directories, view file contents, and practice with file management tasks.
