## 🔧 What I Did

### 🛠️ Key Linux Directories Explored
- **`/` (Root Directory)**: The top-level directory in the file system.
- **`/etc` (Configuration Files)**: Contains system configuration files.
- **`/home` (User Directories)**: Stores personal user directories.
- **`/bin` (Binaries)**: Contains essential system binaries and executables.
- **`/var` (Variable Files)**: Stores files that change frequently, such as logs and caches.
- **`/media`**: Stores external device mount points.
- **`/mnt`**: Used for manually mounting filesystems.
- **`/tmp` (Temporary Files)**: Stores temporary files.

### 🔍 What I Learned
- **Linux File Hierarchy**: The Linux file system is structured in a tree-like hierarchy starting from the root directory (`/`).
- **Key Directories**: Important directories like `/etc`, `/home`, and `/var` are essential for system configuration, user data, and logs.
- **Practical Exploration**: Learned how to navigate and list the contents of key system directories, view file contents, and practice with file management tasks.

## 🔒 Why It Matters
- **System Management**: A solid understanding of the file system structure is essential for effective system administration and file management.
- **Security**: Knowing the locations of important system configuration files, logs, and user directories helps in maintaining system security.
- **Efficiency**: Familiarity with the file system structure improves efficiency when performing tasks like system maintenance, troubleshooting, and managing user data.

### ✅ Future Topics to Explore:
- **File Permissions and Ownership**: Advanced topics like ACLs, special permissions (SUID, SGID, sticky bits).
- **Pipes and Redirection**: Using pipes (`|`) to chain commands and redirect output (`>`, `>>`, `2>`, `&>`) for powerful workflows.
- **Process Management**: Managing and monitoring processes with `ps`, `top`, `kill`, and `htop`.
- **Searching and Finding**: More advanced searching tools like `locate`, `ack`, and `ag`.
- **File Compression and Archiving**: Using commands like `tar`, `gzip`, `zip`, and `unzip`.
- **Shell Scripting**: Automating tasks with shell scripts, conditional statements, loops, and functions.

## 🔑 Quiz Results

**Linux File System Structure Quiz**  
- **Total Score**: 8/10  
- **Mistakes**:  
  - **Question 6**: `/media` stores external device mount points, not configuration files for devices.
  - **Question 7**: User account information is stored in `/etc/passwd`, not `/etc/shadow`.
  - **Question 10**: Temporary files are stored in `/tmp`, not `/var/log`.

User is now ready to move on to the next module.
