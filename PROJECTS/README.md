# 🧠 PROJECTS – Personal Systems Lab

This folder documents real-world systems I’ve built to support cybersecurity training, personal infrastructure, and hands-on experimentation. Every project was created to solve a specific problem — from remote access to log management — and is fully integrated into my daily workflow.

This page serves as both a **blueprint for others** and a **snapshot of systems I actively use**.

## 💻 [`mobile-soc-lab/`](./mobile-soc-lab)
**Hot Lab – MacBook Cyber Terminal**  
A lightweight MacBook setup for portable cybersecurity work. Optimized for red/blue team practice, Git workflows, and secure remote access to my NAS and other devices via Tailscale + SSH.

> *Build it if:* you want a mobile lab that can simulate blue team ops from anywhere, anytime. (Pairs best with `nas-server`)

## 🗃️ [`nas-server/`](./nas-server)
**OpenMediaVault NAS – Storage + Cyber Hub**  
A GMKtec mini PC running OpenMediaVault with a 2TB SSD. Serves as a centralized storage node for GitHub backups, lab data, and personal scripting — while doubling as a remote-access server and secure logging hub.

> *Build it if:* you want your own private server that stores, syncs, and backs up your cybersecurity projects.
