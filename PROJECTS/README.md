# 🧠 PROJECTS – Personal Systems Lab

This folder contains a set of hands-on, self-directed projects designed to improve my skills across cybersecurity, creative workflows, and personal infrastructure design. Each project reflects a specific use case I’ve built around real tools, interoperable devices, and a modular mindset.

Together, these projects form a unified system — where my NAS, MacBook, and Desktop work in sync to support everything from red/blue team simulations to VFX rendering pipelines.

## 🔐 [`iris/`](./iris)
**IRIS – Incident Response Intelligence System**  
A private, AI-powered SOC assistant I’m developing to streamline alert triage, log parsing, and incident reporting. Built as a modular CLI pipeline with Markdown-based outputs and local-first design.  
> *Status:* `v1.0` foundation complete (soft-frozen for now)

## 💻 [`mobile-soc-lab/`](./mobile-soc-lab)
**MacBook Hot-Lab Setup**  
A lightweight, keyboard-driven Linux environment running inside my MacBook. Used for daily Linux practice, managing Git workflows, and simulating red/blue team ops using isolated Kali and Ubuntu VMs.  
> *Interoperates with:* my home NAS and IRIS system over Tailscale + SSH

---

## 🗃️ [`nas-server/`](./nas-server)
**OpenMediaVault-Based Personal NAS**  
My custom NAS built using a GMKtec mini PC, OpenMediaVault, and a 2TB external SSD. This serves as the centralized storage hub for high-resolution video files, IRIS logs, GitHub backups, and cross-device file syncing.  
> *Also used for:* secure remote access, scripting, and lab isolation

## 🧠 Philosophy: Interoperable System Design

- SSH + Tailscale = seamless access from anywhere
- Git = everything versioned, logged, backed up
- Markdown-first = transparent, portable, professional
