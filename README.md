# 🧠 Cybersecurity Lab Notes

> **Educational Use Only**  
This repository documents my personal cybersecurity lab environment, built for hands-on learning in ethical hacking, system administration, and threat detection.  
All tools and techniques are used in **legally controlled environments** and are never intended for unauthorized access to external systems. Always operate within the law and with explicit permission.

## 🧱 Lab Structure

This lab follows a modular format designed for long-term scalability and clarity:
```plaintext
phase-[X][topic]/
└── [module-number][title].md
```

**Example:**  
`phase-1_opsec-setup/01_lab_setup.md`

Each phase maps to a core area of cybersecurity progression (e.g. Linux, Networking, SIEM, Pentesting).  
This structure supports clean versioning, documentation reuse, and clear portfolio presentation.

## 🛠️ Tools I Built to Support This Lab

### `gitbackupnow.sh`  
> **Portable version-controlled backup system**

A custom Bash script that automates versioned `.bundle` backups of this repository (and others).  
It ensures offline portability and robust recovery — useful for air-gapped environments, disaster recovery, or system rebuilds.

## 📌 Notes

- Every module in this lab was built from hands-on experimentation and genuine curiosity.

- While the structure is organized for portfolio readability, the content itself reflects a real learning journey.

- This repository is a living record of my growth, driven by passion, problem-solving, and persistence.
