# 🧠 Cybersecurity Home Lab — Blue Team Simulations & Real-World Growth

This repo isn’t just a portfolio — it’s where I built myself into a SOC analyst from the ground up.

Everything inside was created to simulate real blue team workflows: triaging alerts, writing reports, mastering tools, and automating the repetitive stuff.

It’s structured to grow with me — but also readable and replicable by anyone trying to walk a similar path.
