# 🧠 Cybersecurity Home Lab — Blue Team Simulations & Real-World Growth

> 📄 **[View My Resume](./RESUME.md)** — Full breakdown of my journey, skills, and project history

This repo isn’t just a portfolio — it’s my learning engine.

Built from scratch as a legally controlled SOC simulation environment, this is where I train like it’s day one on the job.

Every folder, every doc, reflects a different piece in my evolving journey.
