### üîÅ Lab Structure:

This lab was fully reorganized to support modular growth and long-term scalability.  
All entries now follow the standardized format:  
`phase-[x]_[topic]/[module-number]_[title].md`

This reorganization improves clarity, streamlines navigation, and supports versioned backups like those generated by my `gitbackupnow.sh` script.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools I Built to Support This Lab

These are custom tools I developed to improve my workflow, security, and data resilience during this cybersecurity learning journey:

- [`gitbackupnow.sh`](https://github.com/00rders/automation-and-tools)  
  A Bash script that automates versioned `.bundle` backups of this GitHub repo (and others).  
  Helps ensure my lab notes are securely backed up and portable, even in offline or air-gapped environments.
