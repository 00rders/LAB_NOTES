**How I Use AI to Augment My Cybersecurity Workflow**

## 🧩 Why I Built This

As a self-taught cybersecurity student, I wanted to accelerate my learning without cutting corners. This document explains how I integrate AI into my daily workflow — not as a shortcut, but as a force multiplier for deep, structured learning.

## 🛠️ My AI-Augmented Workflow

### 1. **Project Planning & Roadmapping**
- I collaborate with AI to design modular roadmaps that mirror industry skills (e.g., Linux, networking, OPSEC).
- Each module is broken into real-world tasks, hands-on exercises, and documentation goals.

### 2. **Daily Lab Work & Problem Solving**
- I treat AI like a senior engineer: asking for best practices, debugging help, and breakdowns when I hit roadblocks.
- All tasks are performed by me inside a secure Kali Linux lab.

### 3. **Documentation & GitHub Sync**
- I log everything in markdown: what I did, what I learned, and why it matters.
- My AI assistant helps with formatting, summaries, and naming consistency — *but all content is hands-on, not generated*.

### 4. **Tooling & Automation**
- I build scripts like `gitbackupnow` with AI-assisted error handling and polish.
- I treat these as professional tools: versioned, documented, tested, and stored securely.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

- **Faster learning** without sacrificing depth
- **Cleaner documentation** for future use and employer transparency
- **Stronger portfolio** built around real technical work and systemized workflows

## 🔒 Responsible Use

I use AI to **enhance** my work, not replace it. Every project is:
- Executed and tested by me
- Backed by hands-on output (screenshots, scripts, logs)
- Logged for reproducibility and auditability

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

As I continue building, this workflow will grow:
- Scheduled backups
- Automated testing
- AI-assisted log parsing
- Modular SOC and pentesting tools
