# Cold Lab Dual-Boot Master Log (Linux + Windows)

> **Summary:** This is the definitive walkthrough and debug log of how I set up EndeavourOS alongside Windows 10 on my desktop (Cold Lab). What started as a basic dual-boot installation turned into a multi-day technical challenge involving EFI limitations, kernel image generation errors, GRUB misconfigurations, and a complete Windows bootloader recovery. This document consolidates all key lessons, commands, and reflections into one power doc for future reference.

## üß† System Layout

| Component       | Description                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Windows**     | `/dev/nvme0n1p1` (100MiB EFI partition) |
| **Linux Root**  | `/dev/sda2` (185GiB ext4 partition)     |
| **Bootloader**  | GRUB (UEFI mode, manually installed)    |
| **Distro**      | EndeavourOS (Arch-based, KDE Plasma)    |
| **Kernel Tool** | Switched from `dracut` to `mkinitcpio`  |

## üìÖ Timeline of Events

### üîß Part 1: EndeavourOS Installation & Linux Boot Fix

#### Phase 1 ‚Äì Initial Install

* Installed EndeavourOS using manual partitioning.
* Reused the existing 100MiB Windows EFI partition. (Ignored warning stating this could cause problems)
* Created a 200GiB partition on `/dev/sda2` for Linux root.

#### Phase 2 ‚Äì Boot Failure & Wrong Assumptions

* GRUB installed, but Linux wouldn‚Äôt boot.
* Spent hours regenerating GRUB, reinstalling kernel, and tweaking boot entries.
* Created a manual GRUB entry ‚Äî kept getting `kernel image not found` errors.
* Assumed GRUB was misconfigured.

‚û°Ô∏è **Missed Insight:** Kernel images weren‚Äôt being generated due to EFI space constraints.

#### Phase 3 ‚Äì Mount Point Correction (Split Boot Configuration)

* This phase marked the turning point where we transitioned from a single shared EFI setup to a proper split-boot configuration.
* Discovered that `/boot` was mounted to the 100MiB EFI partition (too small for kernel/image files).
* Implemented the correct layout for UEFI systems:

  * `/boot` mounted to `/dev/sda2` (Linux root partition)
  * `/boot/efi` mounted to `/dev/nvme0n1p1` (ESP)
* This separation allowed Linux to store its kernel and initramfs files on its own partition without space issues.

#### Phase 4 ‚Äì GRUB Hijack Attempt

* Before addressing the kernel generation issue, we attempted a GRUB hijack to boot into Linux by default.
* Replaced `/boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi` with GRUB in an attempt to hijack the Windows boot path.
* Result: Linux booted, but Windows became unbootable from the GRUB menu.

‚û°Ô∏è This prematurely introduced a new problem ‚Äî Windows bootloader damage ‚Äî before the Linux boot pipeline was fully working.

#### Phase 5 ‚Äì Init Tool Conflict

* Kernel still wouldn't build properly after the mount correction / GRUB hijack.
* Found out EndeavourOS used `dracut` instead of `mkinitcpio`.
* `dracut` wrote kernel files to `/boot/efi`, ignoring our corrected `/boot` mount.
* Fixed with:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -Rns dracut
  sudo pacman -S mkinitcpio
  sudo mkinitcpio -P
  ```

‚úÖ Kernel and initrd now generated in `/boot`, allowing GRUB to function properly.

### ü™ü Part 2: Windows Bootloader Recovery

#### Phase 6 ‚Äì Restoring Windows Boot Entry

* After the GRUB hijack broke Windows booting, we needed to restore the original bootloader.
* To do that, we had to boot into the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) from a USB stick.

**Steps:**

1. From Linux, we downloaded the official Windows 10 ISO using `aria2c` or a browser:

   ```bash
   aria2c https://software-download.microsoft.com/...
   ```

2. Instead of WoeUSB, we opted to use **Ventoy** to create a multiboot recovery USB drive:

   * We downloaded Ventoy from the official site and extracted it.
   * Installed Ventoy to a spare USB drive:

     ```bash
     sudo ./Ventoy2Disk.sh -i /dev/sdX
     ```
   * Simply copied the downloaded `Win10.iso` to the USB drive (no flashing needed).
   * Ventoy detected and booted the ISO seamlessly during boot.

3. Booted into the USB via BIOS/UEFI boot menu.

4. Selected **Repair your computer ‚Üí Troubleshoot ‚Üí Command Prompt** in the Windows Recovery interface.

5. Repaired the EFI boot entry manually:

   ```bash
   diskpart
   list volume
   select volume X  # EFI partition
   assign letter=X
   exit

   bcdboot C:\Windows /s X: /f UEFI
   ```

‚úÖ Windows bootloader restored. GRUB continued to boot Linux. Both OSes were now cleanly bootable.

## üõ† Final Setup (Post-Fix)

| Component           | Value                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Linux Distro        | EndeavourOS (KDE Plasma)             |
| Desktop Environment | KDE Plasma (customized)              |
| Bootloader          | GRUB (manual install)                |
| Kernel Tool         | mkinitcpio (dracut removed)          |
| EFI Strategy        | Split-boot (`/boot` and `/boot/efi`) |

## üß† Key Lessons Learned

* **EFI Warnings Are Serious**: 100MiB is not enough for shared EFI + kernel image storage.
* **Kernel Tools Matter**: `dracut` vs. `mkinitcpio` changes where images get written.
* **Don‚Äôt Trust GRUB Alone**: Check that actual kernel + initrd files exist in `/boot`.
* **Chroot Skills Are Essential**: Know how to mount, chroot, regenerate configs, and recover from a Live USB.
* **GRUB Hijack Is Risky**: Don‚Äôt overwrite Windows boot paths without a recovery plan.
* **Failing Forward Is Valuable**: Every misstep added to my confidence and real-world Linux skill.
* **Ventoy is Invaluable**: For quick ISO booting without flashing, Ventoy makes recovery much more flexible.

## ‚úÖ Final Result

* EndeavourOS + Windows 10 dual boot working flawlessly
* Stable GRUB menu with both OSes bootable
* No data loss
* Full system recovered and documented

## üí¨ Final Reflection

This became the most technically demanding recovery I‚Äôve done to date. It wasn‚Äôt just about typing commands ‚Äî it was about learning to slow down, test assumptions, and understand how EFI, GRUB, kernel tooling, and systemd interact on a real machine. The fix wasn‚Äôt just one command ‚Äî it was a system-level investigation.

If I ever have to rebuild this lab from scratch or help someone recover a broken dual-boot, I‚Äôll know exactly where to start.

üß† Real skill was earned here.
