# ColdLab Dual Boot (Linux + Windows): Installation & Debugging Walkthrough

This is a full walkthrough of how I set up EndeavourOS alongside Windows 10 on my desktop. What started as a standard dual-boot installation turned into the most technically difficult problem I‚Äôve ever solved. It involved GRUB failures, kernel image issues, misdiagnosed bootloader errors, and lessons learned the hard way ‚Äî including what happens when you ignore EFI warnings.

---

## üß≠ Goal

* Install EndeavourOS (KDE Plasma) next to my existing Windows 10 install
* Preserve all data and working Windows boot
* Build a long-term Linux environment for cybersecurity and development

---

## üñ•Ô∏è System Layout

* **nvme0n1** ‚Äì Windows 10 OS (C:) with \~100MiB EFI partition
* **sda** ‚Äì 1TB internal HDD, shrunk to reserve \~185GB for Linux (`/dev/sda2`)
* \**F:\** ‚Äì External SSD holding GitHub projects and lab backups

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Final Setup (Working)

| Component           | Value                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Linux Distro        | EndeavourOS (Arch-based)               |
| Desktop Environment | KDE Plasma (Mercury wallpaper)         |
| Bootloader          | GRUB (manually installed)              |
| Kernel Tool         | mkinitcpio (dracut removed)            |
| EFI Strategy        | Split-boot with corrected kernel paths |

## üöß Problems Encountered

### EFI Size Ignored & Initial Missteps

At the start, the installer warned me that my EFI partition (\~100MiB) was too small for Linux. I ignored it. That mistake spiraled into days of confusion. Initially, I thought GRUB wasn‚Äôt detecting my Linux install because only the Windows Boot Manager showed in `efibootmgr`. I assumed GRUB was misconfigured or missing essential boot entries.

This led me to try manually copying GRUB into the Microsoft EFI path to hijack the boot sequence. I also created a custom EndeavourOS manual boot entry, hoping to force the system to load the right kernel.

### Manual Boot Entry: Kernel Not Found

The custom GRUB entry looked correct, but every attempt failed with `kernel image not found`. This convinced me that GRUB was failing to detect my Linux partition ‚Äî so I doubled down on troubleshooting GRUB config. But this was a red herring.

### Endless Loop: GRUB & Kernel Errors / Reinstalls¬†

I entered a frustrating cycle:

* Boot into EndeavourOS Live USB
* Mount root filesystem and EFI partition
* Chroot into the installed system
* Reinstall GRUB + Kernel
* Reinstall or regenerate kernel
* Reboot ‚Üí still only Windows, or kernel panic, or `image not found`

Every time I rebuilt the kernel using `dracut`, it kept writing the kernel image to `/boot/efi` ‚Äî which pointed to the tiny Windows EFI partition. That partition didn‚Äôt have space for a Linux kernel and initrd. Even though I had a separate `/boot` partition on `/dev/sda2`, `dracut` ignored it.

I thought GRUB was failing ‚Äî but it was the kernel tool writing to the wrong place. A classic case of solving the wrong problem.

---

## üß† Final Fix (Step-by-Step)

Once I realized the real problem was how the kernel image was generated (not where GRUB pointed), the fix became clear:

1. **Remove dracut** ‚Äì the default tool in EndeavourOS

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -Rns dracut
   ```

2. **Install mkinitcpio** ‚Äì Arch‚Äôs traditional kernel image builder

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S mkinitcpio
   ```

3. **Regenerate the kernel image**

   ```bash
   sudo mkinitcpio -P
   ```

   ‚úÖ This wrote the kernel and initrd to `/boot`, not `/boot/efi`

4. **Reinstall GRUB manually**

   ```bash
   grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=GRUB
   grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
   ```

5. **Reboot ‚Üí Success** üéâ
   KDE Plasma finally booted into a stable desktop.

## üß† Key Lessons

* **EFI Warnings Are Serious**: A 100MiB EFI partition isn‚Äôt enough for dual-boot. Resize or rebuild it if possible.
* **It Wasn‚Äôt GRUB**: I wasted hours trying to fix GRUB when the kernel image was the actual issue
* **Kernel Tools Matter**: `dracut` and `mkinitcpio` behave very differently ‚Äî especially in where they write image files
* **Manual Recovery Is Real-World Practice**: I now know how to chroot, mount, inspect EFI paths, and rebuild kernels under pressure
* **Failing Forward**: The custom boot entry, GRUB path hijack, and trial/error cycle weren‚Äôt useless ‚Äî each helped rule things out and gave me confidence debugging low-level boot issues

## üåå ColdLab Now

This system is now:

* My full-time Linux dev and cybersecurity workstation
* Riced with a custom KDE Plasma desktop
* Backed by Git, SSH keys, synced lab repos, and custom shell configs

## üî≠ Next Step

Write a clean, troubleshooting and setup manual from this experience ‚Äî something I can use years from now to recreate this environment with zero internet.

---

## üí¨ Final Thoughts

This experience beat me up ‚Äî but it gave me real, portable skill. I solved something that couldn‚Äôt be fixed by Googling a quick answer. It taught me to slow down, diagnose layer by layer, and validate every assumption. The system boots now, but the real win is everything I learned about EFI, GRUB, kernel generation, and what it actually takes to recover a broken Linux system.
