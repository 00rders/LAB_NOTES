## 🧠 Why I Made This Binder
> "I started seeing patterns in tech support issues — most problems fall into predictable categories. So I created this binder to document efficient, repeatable workflows. It’s designed for speed, clarity, and customer communication."

---

## 🛠️ How It Helps
> "It helps reduce mental load during a busy shift. I can flip to a section, follow a checklist, and feel confident I’ve covered everything — while giving the customer a clear explanation at the end."

> "The formatting is print-ready for lamination and easy to train others with."

## 📂 What’s Inside
Each category module includes:
- Common symptoms
- Tools and technician tips
- Step-by-step workflow
- Customer-friendly explanation script
- A final success checklist

## 📘 The Playbook File
> "There’s a best-practices file in progress too — not for fixing issues, but for how to think, communicate, and escalate as a tech. I left it flexible so I can tailor it to Geek Squad’s internal SOPs."

---

## 🧾 Summary Pitch
> "What I’m building isn’t just a binder — it’s a lightweight technician playbook. It’s built to scale, teach, and improve service delivery — and I’d love to adapt it for the way your team operates."

---

## ✅ Bonus Line (If Asked a Tech Scenario)
> "Can I show you how I handle that in my binder?"
