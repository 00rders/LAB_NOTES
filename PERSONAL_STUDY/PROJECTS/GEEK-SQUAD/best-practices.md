## 🧠 Technician Mindset
- Be the **calm in the chaos** — the customer comes stressed, you bring clarity.  
- Never assume the customer made a mistake — they came to you for help.  
- **Diagnose, solve, and educate** — not just fix.

> “Fix the device, but also fix the feeling.”

- “Any suspicious clicks or downloads recently?”  
- “What’s important to keep safe on your device?”  

**Never start work until you know what data matters most.**

## 🔐 Data Safety SOP
- Ask what data matters most  
- Confirm backup status or offer one

- Use external SSDs or cloud tools if needed

## 💬 Customer Communication
- Speak like a **friendly translator**  
- Validate the issue (“This happens more often than you’d think”)  
- Always end with: what was fixed, what was safe, and prevention tips

**Pro Script:**  
> “Here’s what we found, here’s what we fixed, and here’s how to avoid it in the future. Everything important was kept safe.”
