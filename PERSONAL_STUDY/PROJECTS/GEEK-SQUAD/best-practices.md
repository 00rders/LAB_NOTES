> **Author:** Julian Smith   
> **Purpose:** This is the mindset, tone, and execution guide for field technicians and repair agents. Reference this alongside the Binder when approaching any job.

## 🧠 Technician Mindset

- You are the **calm in the chaos** — the customer comes to you stressed, you bring clarity.
- Never assume the customer did something "stupid" — assume they need help understanding.
- Your job is **diagnose, solve, and educate** — not just fix.

> "Fix the device, but also fix the feeling."

## 📋 Customer Intake Protocol

Always start with these:
- “Can you tell me when the issue started?”
- “What were you doing right before it happened?”
- “Have you clicked on anything suspicious or downloaded anything lately?”
- “What’s important to you on the device — any files, apps, or things we should be careful with?”

**Never begin troubleshooting before identifying if there’s sensitive or irreplaceable data.**

---

## 🔐 Data Safety SOP

Before you touch:
- Ask if any data is mission-critical
- Confirm backup status or offer it
- During OS reinstalls or resets: default to **data preservation mode** unless told otherwise
- Use external SSD or cloud tools when needed

---

## 🛠️ Field USB Toolkit

**Recommended contents:**
- Malwarebytes installer (offline copy)
- CrystalDiskInfo
- CCleaner
- Windows 10/11 ISO or Media Creation Tool
- Driver packs for Dell, HP, etc.
- Autoruns (Sysinternals)
- Portable browsers
- WinRAR or 7zip
- Notepad++

> 🧠 Keep your USB clean, updated, and with a launcher folder.

## 💬 Customer Communication Best Practices

- Speak like a **friendly translator**, not a technician
- Validate the issue (“Yeah, this happens more than you’d think”)
- Always end with: what was fixed, what was kept safe, and what they can do to avoid it again

### ⚡ Pro Script (Finish Every Job With This):
> "Here’s what we found, here’s what we fixed, and here’s how you can avoid it in the future. Everything important was kept safe. Let us know if anything else comes up."

## 🚩 Escalation Threshold

Know when to elevate:
- BIOS password locked (customer forgot it)
- Motherboard/charging port hardware issues
- iCloud lockout
- Full drive failure requiring forensic data recovery
- Windows activation errors post-reinstall

When in doubt: **pause, document, escalate**.
