## 🧠 Technician Mindset
- Be the **calm in the chaos** — the customer comes stressed, you bring clarity.  
- Never assume the customer made a mistake — they came to you for help.  
- **Diagnose, solve, and educate** — not just fix.

> “Fix the device, but also fix the feeling.”

## 📋 Customer Intake Protocol
- “When did the issue start?”  
- “What were you doing right before it happened?”  
- “Any suspicious clicks or downloads recently?”  
- “What’s important to keep safe on your device?”  

**Never start work until you know what data matters most.**

---

## 🔐 Data Safety SOP
- Ask what data matters most  
- Confirm backup status or offer one  
- During reinstalls: **default to data preservation mode**  
- Use external SSDs or cloud tools if needed

## 🛠️ Field USB Toolkit (Essentials)
- Malwarebytes (offline installer)  
- CrystalDiskInfo  
- CCleaner  
- Windows 10/11 ISO  
- Driver packs (Dell, HP, etc.)  
- Autoruns (Sysinternals)  
- Portable browser  
- WinRAR or 7zip  
- Notepad++

> Keep USB **clean, updated, and ready**.

## 💬 Customer Communication
- Speak like a **friendly translator**  
- Validate the issue (“This happens more often than you’d think”)  
- Always end with: what was fixed, what was safe, and prevention tips

**Pro Script:**  
> “Here’s what we found, here’s what we fixed, and here’s how to avoid it in the future. Everything important was kept safe.”

## 🚩 Escalation Threshold
