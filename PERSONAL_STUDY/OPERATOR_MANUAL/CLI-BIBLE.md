## üîß Shell Basics

### Navigation

```bash
pwd          # Print working directory
ls -la       # List all files with details (including hidden)
cd ~         # Go to home directory
cd ..        # Go up one directory
cd /path/to  # Go to specific path
```

### File Management

```bash
touch file.txt              # Create new empty file
micro file.txt              # Open/edit file with Micro
mkdir folder                # Make a new folder
rm file.txt                 # Delete a file
rm -rf folder/              # Delete folder recursively (‚ö†Ô∏è careful)
cp file.txt newname.txt     # Copy file
mv file.txt ~/Documents/    # Move file
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Zsh Environment Essentials

### `~/.zshrc` Overview

* Primary configuration file for the Zsh shell.
* Executes every time a new interactive terminal is launched.
* Controls environment variables, theme settings, plugins, aliases, and custom scripts.

### Essential Load Order Knowledge

* Always declare environment variables (like `EDITOR`, `VISUAL`) **before** theme or plugin loading.
* If using Powerlevel10k, set `POWERLEVEL9K_INSTANT_PROMPT=off` **before** sourcing the instant prompt preamble.
* Custom scripts or banners should be sourced **after** Oh My Zsh is initialized.

### Example Zshrc Breakdown

```zsh
# Set default editor
export EDITOR="micro"
export VISUAL="micro"

# History behavior
export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups  # Avoid duplicate commands in history

# Disable Powerlevel10k's instant prompt to allow banner output
typeset -g POWERLEVEL9K_INSTANT_PROMPT=off

# Powerlevel10k instant prompt preloader (must be above everything else)
if [[ -r "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/p10k-instant-prompt-${(%):-%n}.zsh" ]]; then
  source "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/p10k-instant-prompt-${(%):-%n}.zsh"
fi

# Oh My Zsh core setup
export ZSH="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

# Load custom Hot Lab banner (if exists)
[[ -f ~/.boot-banner/hotlab-banner.sh ]] && source ~/.boot-banner/hotlab-banner.sh
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Git Commands

### Repo Basics

```bash
git clone <url>               # Clone a repo
git status                    # See changes
git add .                     # Stage all changes
git commit -m "message"      # Commit with message
git push                      # Push to remote
git pull                      # Pull latest from remote
```

### Common Sync Errors

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main   # Use this if local commits conflict with upstream
git pull origin main            # Merge remote changes if push fails
git log --oneline --graph       # Visualize commit history
```

### Git SSH Key Setup (Hot Lab)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "gitops@hotlab"
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/gitops_ed25519
```

Then add the public key `~/.ssh/gitops_ed25519.pub` to GitHub.

### `.ssh/config` Entry

```ssh
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitops_ed25519
```

### Repo Refresh / Reset (When in doubt)

```bash
rm -rf ai-playbook automation-and-tools certifications cybersec-lab-notes iris  # Nuke local clones
# Re-clone fresh copies of each repo
cd /f/github-backup
git clone git@github.com:00rders/ai-playbook.git
git clone git@github.com:00rders/automation-and-tools.git
git clone git@github.com:00rders/certifications.git
git clone git@github.com:00rders/cybersec-lab-notes.git
git clone git@github.com:00rders/iris.git
```

## üîê SSH Essentials

### Key Auth Workflow

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096             # Generate new key pair
ssh-copy-id user@remote               # Copy key to remote host
ssh user@host                         # Connect to remote
```

### Config File (`~/.ssh/config`)

```ssh
Host cyber-nas
  HostName 100.x.x.x
  User 00rders
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Then connect with:

```bash
ssh cyber-nas
```

### GitHub SSH Test

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com    # Test if GitHub SSH access is working
```

If `Permission denied (publickey)`:

* Double check the key you added to GitHub matches the one in use
* Confirm your `.ssh/config` is referencing the right key
* Use `ssh-add -l` to list loaded keys
* Run `ssh-add ~/.ssh/gitops_ed25519` if necessary

---

## üß† General Tips

* Use `tab` to auto-complete file names and commands
* Use `Ctrl + C` to cancel a running command
* Use `Ctrl + D` to logout of terminal
* Use `Ctrl + L` to clear the screen

## ‚úèÔ∏è Bonus: Git Line Ending Fix

If you see this warning:

> `CRLF will be replaced by LF the next time Git touches it`

That means Windows line endings will be converted to Linux-friendly ones. You can safely ignore it.

To avoid future warnings:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

This tells Git:

> "Store files with LF endings, but give me CRLF locally so things work nicely on Windows."

---

## üî• UNTRACK A BROKEN OR MOVED FILE FROM GIT (without deleting it)
Use when Git is still tracking a file that no longer exists or was moved outside the repo
```
git rm --cached path/to/file.ext
git commit -m "Remove orphaned file from tracking"
git push
```
## üß† WHY IT MATTERS:
This tells Git to stop tracking the file in version history, even if it no longer exists locally.
Useful when you moved or deleted files outside Git and get errors about "file outside repository".

## üõ† Git Remote Linking & Merge Conflict Reference

### **Linking a Local Repo to GitHub**

**When to Use:**
You‚Äôve created a repo locally and need to link it to a remote GitHub repository.

```bash
# Add the remote
git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git

# Rename current branch to main
git branch -M main
```

---

### **Overwrite GitHub Repo with Local Repo**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This will completely replace the contents of the GitHub repo with your local files.
> Remote history will be **permanently lost**.

**When to Use:**
You want your local repo to be the **source of truth** and discard whatever is currently on GitHub.

```bash
git push -u origin main --force
```

---

### **Merge Local Repo with GitHub Repo**

**When to Use:**
The GitHub repo already has commits/files (e.g., README) that you want to keep and combine with your local repo.

```bash
# Allow unrelated histories to merge
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

# Resolve merge conflicts if prompted, then push
git push -u origin main
```

---

### **Verify Remote Connection**

**When to Use:**
Check the current remote URL(s) configured for your local repo.

```bash
git remote -v
```

‚úÖ Keep this file updated as your workflow evolves. Think of it as your offline co-pilot.
