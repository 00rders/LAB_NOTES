# �� OPERATOR MANUAL — LINUX LEARNING & RECOVERY GUIDE

> **Personalized learning and recovery resource** for managing, troubleshooting, and mastering Linux in real-world conditions. This document was designed to enable consistent growth, quick problem-solving, and long-term OS mastery across any lab environment. If you're reading this and learning from it, it was designed to help you too.

---

## �� Purpose

This guide is more than a cheat sheet — it's a curated **offline learning system**, toolkit reference, and troubleshooting manual based on real issues encountered and solved while building and maintaining portable Git-based Linux workflows.

It includes:

* How to **level up Linux skills** without AI or internet
* Tools for **syntax mastery**, man page navigation, and quick memory jogs
* Fully offline documentation and **local wiki access**
* Go-to methods for safely **testing, reading, and configuring** Linux systems

---

## �� Essential Learning Tools (Offline)

### 1. `man` + `vim` + Syntax Highlighting

* Set Vim or Neovim as default pager:

```bash
export MANPAGER="nvim +Man!"
```

* Syntax-highlighted, regex-searchable, markable man pages
* Combine with `:set number` in `nvim` for long docs like `ffmpeg`

### 2. `tldr` (Teal Deer)

* TL;DR command cheat sheets with practical examples
* Use this when you forget syntax or want quick copy-paste examples

```bash
sudo pacman -S tealdeer
```

* Refresh cache:

```bash
tldr --update
```

### 3. `wikiman` + Arch Wiki

* Download entire Arch Wiki for **offline terminal use**
* Lets you search and read documentation even when your display is broken

```bash
sudo pacman -S wikiman
wikiman hyperland
```

* Save full docs for things like:

  * Display servers (X11 → Wayland)
    * Window managers (Hyprland, i3, KDE)
      * Systemd configuration
        * File system rescue, Btrfs tips, etc.

        ### 4. `/OPERATOR_MANUAL/`

        > You're already here.

        * Includes real troubleshooting logs (`dual-boot-setup-&-troubleshooting.md`)
        * Git + SSH setup
        * Boot recovery, micro config, alias functions, terminal setup
        * Fully version-controlled with `.bundle` backups to external SSD
