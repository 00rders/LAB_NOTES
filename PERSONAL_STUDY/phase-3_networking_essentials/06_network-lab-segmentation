# 06 ‚Äî Network Lab Segmentation (Capstone)

This module marks the culmination of my Phase 3 networking work. It consolidates concepts like:
- NAT-based VM isolation
- Secure NAS positioning
- Public Wi-Fi OPSEC for portable labs
- Remote access design
- Future VLAN/pfSense expansion

üõ†Ô∏è The full documentation lives in [`projects/network-lab-segmentation`](../../projects/network-lab-segmentation), where I walk through the full architecture, decisions, and setups.

This module serves as the final checkpoint before progressing to more advanced network defense and offensive tooling.
