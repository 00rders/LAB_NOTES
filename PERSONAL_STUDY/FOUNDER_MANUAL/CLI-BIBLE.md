## 🔧 Shell Basics

### Navigation

```bash
pwd          # Print working directory
ls -la       # List all files with details (including hidden)
cd ~         # Go to home directory
cd ..        # Go up one directory
cd /path/to  # Go to specific path
```

### File Management

```bash
touch file.txt              # Create new empty file
micro file.txt              # Open/edit file with Micro
mkdir folder                # Make a new folder
rm file.txt                 # Delete a file
rm -rf folder/              # Delete folder recursively (⚠️ careful)
cp file.txt newname.txt     # Copy file
mv file.txt ~/Documents/    # Move file
```

## ⚙️ Zsh Environment Essentials

### `~/.zshrc` Overview

* Primary configuration file for the Zsh shell.
* Executes every time a new interactive terminal is launched.
* Controls environment variables, theme settings, plugins, aliases, and custom scripts.

### Essential Load Order Knowledge

* Always declare environment variables (like `EDITOR`, `VISUAL`) **before** theme or plugin loading.
* If using Powerlevel10k, set `POWERLEVEL9K_INSTANT_PROMPT=off` **before** sourcing the instant prompt preamble.
* Custom scripts or banners should be sourced **after** Oh My Zsh is initialized.

### Example Zshrc Breakdown

```zsh
# Set default editor
export EDITOR="micro"
export VISUAL="micro"

# History behavior
export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups  # Avoid duplicate commands in history

# Disable Powerlevel10k's instant prompt to allow banner output
typeset -g POWERLEVEL9K_INSTANT_PROMPT=off

# Powerlevel10k instant prompt preloader (must be above everything else)
if [[ -r "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/p10k-instant-prompt-${(%):-%n}.zsh" ]]; then
  source "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/p10k-instant-prompt-${(%):-%n}.zsh"
fi

# Oh My Zsh core setup
export ZSH="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

# Load custom Hot Lab banner (if exists)
[[ -f ~/.boot-banner/iris-hotlab.sh ]] && source ~/.boot-banner/iris-hotlab.sh
```

## 🛠️ Git Commands

### Repo Basics

```bash
git clone <url>             # Clone a repo
git status                  # See changes
git add .                   # Stage all changes
git commit -m "message"    # Commit with message
git push                    # Push to remote
git pull                    # Pull latest from remote
```

### Useful Aliases *(to define later)*

```bash
gitpushall    # Add, commit, and push all changes
gitstatus     # Shortcut for git status
gitcheck      # Check current branch & sync state
```

## 🔐 SSH Essentials

### Key Auth Workflow

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096             # Generate new key pair
ssh-copy-id user@remote               # Copy key to remote host
ssh user@host                         # Connect to remote
```

### Config File (`~/.ssh/config`)

```ssh
Host cyber-nas
  HostName 100.x.x.x
  User 00rders
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Then connect with:

```bash
ssh cyber-nas
```
