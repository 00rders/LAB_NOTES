# 02 â€” Firewall Basics (UFW)

## ðŸ§© Scenario  
Block all inbound traffic to keep the VM invisible on the LAN.

## ðŸ”§ What I Did
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ufw -y
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose
```
- Verified the firewall status and rules
- Ensured that outbound traffic (browser traffic, apt updates) still worked

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- "ufw" simplifies managing network rules compared to raw "iptables"
- Default-deny inbound policy helps reduce exopusre
- Linux firewalls enforce kernel-level filtering at the packet level

## ðŸ”’ Why It Matters
Running vulnerable or misconfigured services without a firewall could expose the VM to scanning, exploits, or lateral movement on a shared network. A locked-down firewall is a critical first layer of defense in any OPSEC or pen-testing setup.

ðŸ¤– What could IRIS do?
Monitor Firewall Logs: Continuously parse logs (e.g., ufw.log or iptables) to detect port scans, brute-force attempts, or denied outbound traffic.

Alert on Anomalies: Flag unusual ports being opened or closed, especially those deviating from baseline rules.

Automate Rule Validation: Periodically compare live firewall rules against a known-good policy to catch misconfigurations or unauthorized changes.
