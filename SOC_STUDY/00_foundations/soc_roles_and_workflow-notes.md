# **SOC Foundations: Roles & Workflow — Essential Notes**

## **1. What is a SOC?**
- Centralized security team that monitors, detects, investigates, and responds to cyber threats.
- Operates **24/7** in shifts to ensure continuous protection.
- Main goal: **Minimize damage** and **reduce recovery time**.

## **2. Core SOC Roles**
| Role | Main Responsibility |
|------|--------------------|
| **Tier 1 Analyst (Alert Triage)** | Monitor SIEM alerts, validate them, escalate real threats, dismiss false positives. |
| **Tier 2 Analyst (Investigation)** | Deep-dive on escalations, correlate logs, analyze incidents. |
| **Tier 3 Analyst / Threat Hunter** | Proactive threat hunting, advanced forensics, incident leadership. |
| **SOC Manager** | Oversees operations, defines processes, manages reporting. |
| **Supporting Roles** | Threat Intel, SOC Engineers, Red/Purple Teams. |

## **3. SOC Workflow (Typical Path)**
1. **Detection** — Alert generated by SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel, QRadar, etc.).
2. **Triage** — Tier 1 validates the alert.
3. **Investigation** — Tier 2 correlates events, determines root cause.
4. **Containment & Eradication** — Incident response actions taken.
5. **Post-Incident Review** — Lessons learned, playbook updates.

## **4. SIEM’s Role**
- Collects and normalizes logs from multiple sources.
- Correlation rules trigger alerts.
- Analysts use it for search, dashboards, timelines, and reporting.

## **5. Key Tools in a SOC**
- **SIEM:** Splunk, Sentinel, QRadar.
- **EDR:** CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Carbon Black.
- **SOAR:** Automates repetitive tasks and incident responses.
- **Threat Intel Platforms:** MISP, Recorded Future.
- **Case/Ticketing Systems:** ServiceNow, JIRA.
