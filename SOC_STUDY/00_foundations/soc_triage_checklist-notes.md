# SOC Roles & Workflow

## 📖 Concept
A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is the nerve center for detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents.  
SOC teams work in **tiers** to ensure alerts are handled efficiently and threats are contained quickly.

### Core SOC Roles
- **Tier 1 Analyst (Alert Monitor)**
  - First line of defense — monitors SIEM dashboards, validates alerts, escalates if needed.
- **Tier 2 Analyst (Incident Investigator)**
  - Performs deeper log correlation and root cause analysis, validates true positives, and begins containment steps.
- **Tier 3 Analyst (Threat Hunter / Forensics)**
  - Handles advanced persistent threats, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and long-term remediation plans.
- **Incident Responder**
  - Coordinates technical and business response actions, liaises with leadership, and manages incident lifecycle.
- **Threat Hunter**
  - Proactively searches for hidden threats that haven’t triggered alerts.

### Typical Incident Lifecycle
1. **Detection** — Alert is generated by SIEM.
2. **Validation** — Tier 1 confirms if the alert is real.
3. **Investigation** — Tier 2 digs deeper, correlates events.
4. **Containment** — Tier 3/IR team stops the threat.
5. **Eradication & Recovery** — Restore systems, remove threat.
6. **Post-Incident Review** — Lessons learned and tuning.

## 🛠 Hands-On in Splunk Lab
1. **Log into your Splunk Hot Lab.**
2. Navigate to `Search & Reporting` → Observe available indexes and log sources.
3. For each log type, note:
   - **Source** (e.g., firewall, endpoint, application)
   - **Potential SOC Role Usage** (which tier would use it and why)

## 🌍 Real-World SOC Example
**Scenario:** You’re a Tier 1 analyst at a financial SOC.  
- **Tier 1**: Sees multiple failed logins on an executive account → Validates and escalates.  
- **Tier 2**: Correlates with VPN logs and IDS alerts to check for suspicious patterns.  
- **Tier 3**: Containment — blocks the source IP, resets account credentials, analyzes attack vector.
