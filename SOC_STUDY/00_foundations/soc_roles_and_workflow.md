# **🛡️ SOC Foundations: Roles & Workflow — Essential Notes**

## **1. 🏢 What is a SOC?**
- Centralized security team that monitors, detects, investigates, and responds to cyber threats.  
- Operates **24/7** in shifts to ensure continuous protection.  
- Main goal: **Minimize damage** and **reduce recovery time**.

## **2. 👥 Core SOC Roles**
| Role | Main Responsibility |
|------|--------------------|
| **👀 Tier 1 Analyst (Alert Triage)** | Monitor SIEM alerts, validate them, escalate real threats, dismiss false positives. |
| **🔍 Tier 2 Analyst (Investigation)** | Deep-dive on escalations, correlate logs, analyze incidents. |
| **🧠 Tier 3 Analyst / Threat Hunter** | Proactive threat hunting, advanced forensics, incident leadership. |
| **📊 SOC Manager** | Oversees operations, defines processes, manages reporting. |
| **🔗 Supporting Roles** | Threat Intel, SOC Engineers, Red/Purple Teams. |

## **3. 🔄 SOC Workflow (Typical Path)**
1. **🚨 Detection** — Alert generated by SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel, QRadar, etc.).
2. **⚖️ Triage** — Tier 1 validates the alert.
3. **🕵️ Investigation** — Tier 2 correlates events, determines root cause.
4. **🧯 Containment & Eradication** — Incident response actions taken.
5. **📘 Post-Incident Review** — Lessons learned, playbook updates.

## **4. 🧭 SIEM’s Role**
- Collects and normalizes logs from multiple sources.  
- Correlation rules trigger alerts.  
- Analysts use it for search, dashboards, timelines, and reporting.

## **5. 🧰 Key Tools in a SOC**
- **🖥️ SIEM:** Splunk, Sentinel, QRadar  
- **🛡️ EDR:** CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Carbon Black  
- **🤖 SOAR:** Automates repetitive tasks and incident responses  
- **🌐 Threat Intel Platforms:** MISP, Recorded Future  
- **📋 Case/Ticketing Systems:** ServiceNow, JIRA
