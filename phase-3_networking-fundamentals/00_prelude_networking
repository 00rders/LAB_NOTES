# 00 â€” Prelude to Networking

## ðŸ§© Context
In this module, we focus on the fundamental concepts of networking. Rather than manually calculating subnets or diving too deeply into theoretical subnetting, the goal is to understand the **tools** used in real-world networking and apply them in practical scenarios. We will leverage tools like **ipcalc**, **nmap**, and **ping** for network configuration, subnetting, and scanning tasks.

## ðŸ”§ What I Did

### Networking Basics and Tools:
- **Learned about the purpose and structure of IP addresses**:
  - **IPv4** vs **IPv6**
  - **Private vs Public IP addresses**
- **Subnetting concepts** were explored, focusing on **CIDR notation**, **subnet masks**, and the **network and host portions**.
  - Subnetting will be automated using tools like **ipcalc**.
- **Tested basic network connectivity** using:
  - **ping** for checking device reachability
  - **traceroute** to visualize the route data takes through the network
- **Used online and command-line tools** to calculate subnets and check IP ranges:
  - **`ipcalc`** to automatically calculate subnets, IP ranges, and broadcast addresses.
  - **Online subnet calculators** to quickly verify subnetting calculations.

### Tools Focus:
- **Used `nmap`** to explore network scanning and discover devices.
- **Configured network interfaces** with `ip` and `ifconfig` on Kali Linux.
- **Tested connectivity** by pinging devices within my local network.
- **Documented steps in real-world configurations** using the tools for automated subnetting.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- **Subnetting and CIDR Notation**: I understand how to divide networks into subnets, but I will use tools like **`ipcalc`** and **`subnettingcalculator.com`** for automation.
- **Network Tools**: Learned how to use **`ping`** for connectivity checks and **`nmap`** for network scanning and discovery. These tools are essential in cybersecurity and network management.
- **Automation**: Tools like **`ipcalc`** streamline subnetting, reducing manual calculation time and minimizing errors.

## ðŸ”’ Why It Matters
- **Efficiency**: Automating subnetting and network configuration allows for faster and more accurate network management.
- **Real-World Application**: These tools are used in actual network setups and security assessments, making them essential for both **networking** and **cybersecurity** professionals.
- **Practical Network Management**: Understanding how to configure and scan networks is crucial for managing and securing real-world systems.

### âœ… Next Steps:
- Proceed to **Phase 3 Modules** where we'll dive into more practical networking configurations, focusing on **network scanning**, **troubleshooting**, and **network security** using industry-standard tools.
