# 00 â€” Prelude to Networking

## ðŸ§© Context
In this module, I focused on gaining a fundamental understanding of networking concepts with an emphasis on real-world tools. Rather than getting caught up in manual subnetting calculations, the goal is to **understand the underlying concepts** (like IP addressing, subnetting, and CIDR notation) and then use the **tools** that automate these processes in real-world scenarios.

## ðŸ”§ What I Did

### Key Networking Concepts:
- **Explored the difference between public and private IP addresses** and how each communicates within a network.
- **Learned the structure of IP addresses** and how to read IPs and their common private ranges.
- **Understood what a subnet is** and how **CIDR notation** works. I also learned how to **convert** between subnet masks, IPs, and CIDR notation to find the **broadcast address** and the **range of available IPs** in a subnet.
- **Used `ipcalc`** to quickly calculate network details, such as subnet ranges, broadcast addresses, and available IPs.

### Tools Focus:
- After using **`ipcalc`**, I realized how much time and effort is saved by using **tools** to automate subnetting processes, which are more efficient than manual calculations.
  
## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- **Subnetting**: I now understand **how subnets work** and how to use tools to calculate them quickly and efficiently.
- **CIDR Notation**: I became comfortable with **CIDR notation** and how it relates to subnet masks and IP ranges.
- **Networking Tools**: Tools like **`ipcalc`** make complex tasks like subnetting much faster and more accurate than doing it manually.

## ðŸ”’ Why It Matters
- **Efficiency**: Using tools like **`ipcalc`** saves significant time when managing networks and calculating subnets.
- **Real-World Application**: In professional network configurations or cybersecurity work, tools are used to automate tasks like subnetting and address calculations.
- **Practical Skills**: Understanding the concepts behind networking and using tools effectively is more valuable than manually doing calculations that can be automated.

### âœ… Next Steps:
- **Move forward to Phase 3 Modules**, where we will apply these concepts directly in real-world scenarios such as:
  - **Configuring network interfaces** and setting static IPs.
  - **Testing connectivity** and troubleshooting using `ping` and other tools.
  - **Exploring network security** and segmentation with hands-on exercises using real tools.
