# 99 — Phase 3 Review: Networking Checkpoint

## 🧠 Review Focus

This checkpoint was designed to assess my retention of core networking concepts so far:
- Private IP address ranges
- Subnetting (e.g. broadcast and usable IPs)
- Real-world tool usage like `ipcalc`

## ✅ Mini Quiz Results

**Answers:**  
1) ❌ 10.0.0.0/8 was mistakenly marked as public  
2) ❌ Broadcast for /26 was misunderstood  
3) ✅ Correctly answered ipcalc functionality

## 🧩 What I Relearned

- The private IP ranges are:
  - `10.0.0.0/8`
  - `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255`
  - `192.168.0.0/16`

- A `/26` subnet has:
  - 64 IPs total
  - `.63` is the broadcast address
  - `.1`–`.62` are usable

- `ipcalc` helps visualize subnetting by outputting:
  - Network address
  - Broadcast address
  - Host range
  - CIDR/netmask breakdown

## 🔁 Reflection

Although I missed a couple answers, I understood the reasoning after review. These were minor gaps — not major blockers.

This checkpoint proves I'm learning **actively**, not passively. I’m ready to move forward while reinforcing these topics through repetition and hands-on use.
