# Module 02: Network Troubleshooting

## üß© Context
In this module, I learned how to diagnose and verify basic network connectivity using commands like `ping`, interpreting results for both internal and external targets. These tools are essential for confirming whether a system is reachable and connected to the wider internet or isolated due to misconfiguration or firewall restrictions.

This kind of troubleshooting is a foundational part of SOC analyst workflows and helps validate that networking components (DNS, gateway, internet, etc.) are functioning as expected.

## üîß What I Did

### 1. **Pinged an IP Address Directly**
- Tested connectivity to Google's DNS server at `8.8.8.8`:
  ```bash
  ping 8.8.8.8
  ```
- **Result**
  ```python
  64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=114 time=28.8 ms
  ...
  4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss
  ```
- **Observation**
  - *The network is online and functional*
  - *No DNS is needed for this test, since we're using a direct IP address*
 
### 2. **Pinged a Domain Name**
- Tested *DNS* resolution and connectivity to `google.com`:
  ```bash
  ping google.com
  ```
- **Result**
  ```python
  64 bytes from atl26s14-in-f14.1e100.net (172.217.12.110): icmp_seq=1 ttl=114 time=20.5 ms
  ...
  4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss
  ```
- **Observation**
  - *The system successfully resolved the domain name to an IP*
  - *Confirms that DNS is working properly and outbound traffic is allowed*

## üß† What I Learned

- **Ping** tests let you verify:
  - If your system can reach another device on the network or internet.
  - If DNS is working (when using a domain name).
  - Round-trip latency (network responsiveness).
- **TTL** and **time** values show how many hops exist and the response time.
- **Packet loss** indicates potential issues with connectivity or routing.

---

## üîí Why It Matters

- **Critical for SOC Analysts**: Quick ping tests help analysts confirm if a reported issue is network-related before escalating or taking further action.
- **Diagnostic Foundation**: Understanding how to interpret ICMP responses is a must for effective troubleshooting, especially when working with remote endpoints or investigating alerts.

---

## üè¶ Real-World Application Scenario(s)

- **Scenario**: You're working in a SOC and receive an alert that a production web server is down. Your first step is to `ping` the server‚Äôs IP address to confirm it‚Äôs reachable.
  - If it fails, you try the default gateway or an external IP (like `8.8.8.8`) to see if it‚Äôs a local network or full internet issue.
  - If `ping google.com` fails but `ping 8.8.8.8` works, you can narrow it down to a **DNS issue**.

- **Outcome**: This kind of quick triage saves time, narrows scope, and avoids unnecessary escalations ‚Äî a key skill for any junior SOC analyst.

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

- Test failed ping scenarios (e.g., blocked by firewall or DNS failure).
- Use `traceroute` to understand path tracing.
- Begin exploring `netstat`, `ss`, and `ifconfig/ip a` for deeper troubleshooting.

# Module 02: Network Troubleshooting ‚Äî Traceroute Interpretation

## üß© Context
This part of the module focuses on using the `traceroute` command to visually map the path that packets take from the Kali VM to an external domain, in this case: `google.com`. This is a key tool for identifying bottlenecks, packet loss, and upstream ISP issues.

## üîß What I Did

### Ran a Basic Traceroute to Google:
```bash
traceroute google.com
```

### Sample Output:
```scss
 1  192.168.x.1
 2  192.168.1.1
 3  100.93.xxx.x
 4  *.ccal.comcast.net          (masked city/PoP)
 ...
16  nuq04s43-in-f14.1e100.net   (Google edge)
```

## üß† What I Learned

- **Traceroute Shows the Path**:  
  The `traceroute` command reveals each network hop between your local machine and a target server (in this case, `google.com`). Each numbered line represents a router or device that the packet passes through.

- **Local and ISP Infrastructure**:  
  The first few hops are internal to your local network and ISP infrastructure. For example:  
  - `192.168.x.1` ‚Äî Your router or access point.  
  - `100.xxx.xxx.xxx` ‚Äî Likely Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT) addresses used by ISPs.  
  - `*.comcast.net` ‚Äî DNS-resolved names showing your packet flowing through different regional routers.

- **Public Transit and Destination**:  
  The final hops show Google's infrastructure (`*.1e100.net`) with minimal latency, confirming successful end-to-end packet travel across your ISP and backbone networks.

- **Asterisks (*) in Output**:  
  These indicate a timeout or unresponsive router (not necessarily an issue). Some routers are configured to ignore ICMP Time Exceeded messages used by traceroute.

- **Packet Timing (ms)**:  
  The millisecond values next to each hop indicate round-trip latency to that hop. It‚Äôs useful for identifying bottlenecks or delays in a route.

## üîí Why It Matters

- **Troubleshooting Power**:  
  Traceroute is a foundational skill for identifying where a network slowdown, routing failure, or packet loss might be occurring. It's a first step for network analysts when debugging connectivity issues.

- **ISP and Backbone Awareness**:  
  Knowing how to read hostnames like `yubacity.ca.ccal.comcast.net` gives you insight into how your packets flow through regional infrastructure and major internet backbones.

- **Security Relevance**:  
  Traceroute can be used in penetration testing to **map out internal networks** if responses are not filtered, revealing organizational infrastructure and geographic data that may aid in targeting.

## üè¶ Real-World Application Scenario

- **SOC Analyst**:  
  A customer reports slow access to cloud services. As the first responder, you use `traceroute` to identify whether the issue lies within the customer‚Äôs local network, their ISP, or the destination provider‚Äôs infrastructure.

- **Red Team Scenario**:  
  During external recon, an ethical hacker runs `traceroute` to a company‚Äôs public IP. The output reveals naming conventions and geographic locations of firewalls, routers, and regional nodes, helping map the target's footprint.
